## Getting started with the OpenAPI

The SigniFlow OpenAPI API is intended to manage the initiation, cancellation and removal of document workflows created within the SigniFlow system. The API will also manage the security control within the SigniFlow system and generation of workflow steps.

## Signing Ceremonies
--- 

**TURN YOUR ONLINE APPLICATION INTO ITS OWN CRYPTOGRAPHIC SIGNATURE ENGINE AND HAVE YOUR CUSTOMERS SIGN ONLINE IN YOUR APP.**

The fastest cryptographic signature API on the market. The â€˜Signature Ceremony APIâ€™ is a high-speed, convenient, purpose-built API that can be integrated with any web service where it is required for the signatory to digitally sign a document, using a third-party application.

### Signing Ceremony
Unlike standard SigniFlow APIs the â€˜Signature Ceremony APIâ€™ does not utilise standard SigniFlow functions, workflow engine functions or the standard SigniFlow user-authentication process. Instead, it relies on the third-party application to perform certain - or all of these - functions, and pass the information (trust) to the â€˜Signature APIâ€™, which will use the trust data received from the application to cryptographically sign the document and embed said information in the digital signature.

Trust in the form of authentication is transferred to the third-party application by reference, and only the signature operation is performed by the Signature API. It is therefore expected that the application performs multi-factor authentication of the user, before calling the API.
